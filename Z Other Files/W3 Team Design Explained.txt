For our design we will have a journal class that will get the random entry and be able to write and load to the file. For our menu class we'll have it display the menu. As well as when you save a journal entry to a file, have it get the file name and the date and time to match with it. Lastly, our program class will loop infinitely through the options until you quit the application.
